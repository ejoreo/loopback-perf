This repository is a basic Loopback application generated with the LoopBack 4 CLI.

Run `npm start` from the root directory to boot the application and visit http://127.0.0.1:3000/hello to see ‘Hello world!’

To benchmark this application with [Apache Bench](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_bench/index.htm), run `ab -k -n 50000 -c 100 -t 20 127.0.0.1:3000/hello` in a separate terminal window.
